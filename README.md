# Dynamic Query for JPA

This project is a work in progress and not yet ready for production use. Main goal is to provide a simple
but powerful way to dynamically apply filters in any JPA-based application, mainly microservices that provide
REST APIs (it enables the resources to have dynamic filters similar to what GraphQL provides).

This document will be updated in the future as the project evolves with more details on the goals, features and
how to use them. For now, you can follow the repo to get notified about future updates.
